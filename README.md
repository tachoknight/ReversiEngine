# ReversiEngine
This project is a [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) engine written in C++11. It consists of a working engine without any graphics; everything is output to the console as debug text.
## Reason
I read with facination about Google's [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) program that was defeating Go masters and was curious how the program worked. I read up on the machine learning techniques it employs and thought it'd be fun to try it myself.

I taught myself Go and quickly realized that it is, for all its simplicity, an amazingly complex game in terms of strategy (I rank myself at around 10,000 kyu) and thought to start with something 'simpler'. I remembered playing Othello when I was a kid and, being something like Go, opted to give that a try first to learn how to handle writing a game with discs, colors, dimensions, etc.

This project represents the beginning of that effort; it is a complete program where the computer plays both sides, light and dark and I am using it as a base for adding things like strategies, human-computer play, and eventually some sort of actual graphical interface.
